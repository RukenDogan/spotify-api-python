* This projet is a test to help me learn to use APIs. Here the Spotify API *

* The program displays artist and tracks *



- I've created an account on : https://developer.spotify.com/
- Learned how to get the client id and client secret (then paste it to a .env file)
- Create a main python file, import libraries, install packages
- Work with keys and tokens 
- I've also learned how to hide files, such as .env file that contains the API keys
  --> By adding a .gitignore file


Commands :

  git init (git will follow all the changes of the files of this project)
  git status (to check if the file .env is hidden)
  git add . (to save the changes)
  git commit -m "First commit ..."

New repo :

  git remote add origin https://github.com/**/** (repos url)
  git branch -M main (creates the main branch)
  git push -u origin main (then sends it)
