# 🎧 Spotify API Learning Project

This project is a personal learning exercise to help me understand how to work with REST APIs, using the Spotify API as an example.

# 🌟 What It Does

  - Connects to the Spotify API

  - Retrieves and displays information about artists and tracks


# 🚀 Steps I Followed

  - Created a developer account on Spotify for Developers

  - Learned how to get my Client ID and Client Secret

   - Stored credentials securely in a .env file

   - Installed required libraries and created a main Python script

   - Handled authentication with access tokens

   - Learned how to hide sensitive files like .env using a .gitignore file


# 🔧 Git Commands I Used

// Initialize Git

git init

// Check if .env is ignored

git status

// Add and commit changes

git add .

git commit -m "First commit"

// Link to remote repository

git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main


# 📁 File Highlights

  - .env → stores API credentials (never pushed to GitHub)

  - .gitignore → ensures sensitive files like .env are not tracked

  - main.py → contains the core logic to interact with the Spotify API
